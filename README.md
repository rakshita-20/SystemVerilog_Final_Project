ECE 571: Intro to SystemVerilog 001 Final Project

Project uses: system-level design and integration of Intel 8088 processor bus with the memory/IO module, creation and use of SystemVerilog interfaces, $readmemh,
bus-functional models, FSM modeling, and using protected SystemVerilog IP

Steps to follow to run the project-
Step 1: Run the final.do file
Step 2: Observe the waveforms
Step 3: Observe the data on the data bus in Read and Write operations to verify that
		    the timing is followed for the transfer of data
